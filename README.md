# EGG Protocol

## Short Description

EGG Protocol multiplies yields by enabling assets escrowing on cross-chain smart contracts.

Cocoricos.io permits frictionless access to decentralized finance (DeFi). Data-driven due diligence filters best-in-class proof of liquidity and proof of stake assets around a single interface.

This repository contains the EGG Token implementation and its set of smart contracts for a staking, voting and periodic token burns and a lockable token distribution.
